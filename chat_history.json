Introduction  \nThe purpose of this document is to outline the business requirements for the Snowflake data migration \nproject. The project aims to migrate our existing data warehouse to the Snowflake platform, leveraging \nits scalability, performance, and cloud -native architecture.  \n2. Business Objectives  \n\u2022 Migrate the existing data warehouse to Snowflake, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing \noperations.  \n\u2022 Improve data processing performance and scalability to accommodate growing business needs.  \n\u2022 Enable advanced analytics and reporting capabilities through Snowflake's features.  \n\u2022 Enhance data security and compliance with industry standards.  \n\u2022 Reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs by leveragin g Snowflake's cloud -based \ninfrastructure.  \n3. Scope  \nThe data migration project will encompass the following areas:  \n\u2022 Analysis and assessment of the current data warehouse infrastructure.  \n\u2022 Designing the Snowflake data model and schema to accommodate the existin g data.  \n\u2022 Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) the data from the current data warehouse to \nSnowflake.  \n\u2022 Verifying the accuracy and integrity of the migrated data.  \n\u2022 Implementing necessary data governance and access controls.  \n\u2022 Optimizing queries and data re trieval performance in Snowflake.  \n\u2022 Training and knowledge transfer to the relevant teams for ongoing maintenance and usage.  \n4. Stakeholders  \n\u2022 Project Sponsor: [Name]  \n\u2022 Project Manager: [Name]  \n\u2022 Data Warehouse Team: [Names]  \n\u2022 Business Intelligence Team: [Names]  \n\u2022 IT Operations Team: [Names]  5. Functional Requirements  \n5.1 Data Migration  \n\u2022 Extract data from the current data warehouse, including tables, views, and stored procedures.  \n\u2022 Transform the data as necessary to align with the Snowflake data model.  \n\u2022 Load the transformed data into Snowflake using appropriate ETL processes and tools.  \n\u2022 Ensure data integrity and accuracy during the migration process.  \n\u2022 Migrate data incrementally to minimize downtime and maintain data consistency.  \n5.2 Snowflake Data Model and Schema  \n\u2022 Analyze the existing data model and schema.  \n\u2022 Design and create the Snowflake data model and schema to accommodate the migrated data.  \n\u2022 Define tables, views, and relationships based on business requirements.  \n\u2022 Optimize the Snowflake data model for performance and  scalability.  \n5.3 Data Governance and Security  \n\u2022 Implement appropriate access controls and permissions in Snowflake.  \n\u2022 Define data ownership and responsibilities.  \n\u2022 Establish data governance policies and procedures.  \n\u2022 Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy r egulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  \n5.4 Performance Optimization  \n\u2022 Analyze query performance in Snowflake and identify areas for optimization.  \n\u2022 Optimize SQL queries, indexing, and data partitioning.  \n\u2022 Monitor and tune performance to ensure efficient data retrieval a nd processing.  \n6. Non -Functional Requirements  \n6.1 Scalability and Performance  \n\u2022 Snowflake should handle increasing data volumes and user concurrency without significant \nperformance degradation.  \n\u2022 Response times for queries and data retrieval should meet agreed -upon service -level \nagreements (SLAs).  \n6.2 Availability and Reliability  \n\u2022 Snowflake should provide high availability and ensure minimal downtime.  \u2022 Backup and disaster recovery procedures should be in place to protect against data loss.  \n6.3 Security and Compliance  \n\u2022 Snowflake should provide robust security features, including encryption, access controls, and \nauditing capabilities.  \n\u2022 Compliance with relevant data protection and privacy regulations should be maintained.  \n6.4 Usability and User Experience  \n\u2022 Snowfla ke should have an intuitive user interface and provide ease of use for data analysts, \nbusiness users, and administrators.  \n\u2022 Training and documentation should be provided to enable users to effectively work with \nSnowflake.  \n7. Assumptions and Constraints  \n\u2022 The proj ect team will have access to the necessary resources, including hardware, software, and \nskilled personnel.  \n\u2022 The current data warehouse can be effectively extracted from and migrated to Snowflake \nwithout significant data loss or corruption.  \n8. The project timel ine should consider any dependencies on other ongoing projects or system \nupgrades.  \n9. Risks and Mitigation Strategies  \n\u2022 Risk: Data integrity issues during the migration process.  \n\u2022 Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and validation of the migrated data at each st age. \nImplement data validation checks and reconciliation processes.  \n\u2022 Risk: Performance issues in Snowflake affecting query response times.  \n\u2022 Mitigation: Perform performance testing and optimization, including query tuning, \nindexing, and partitioning strategie s. \n\u2022 Risk: Lack of user adoption and resistance to change.  \n\u2022 Mitigation: Provide comprehensive training and documentation to users. Communicate \nthe benefits of Snowflake and address any concerns or resistance through change \nmanagement activities.  \n9.
